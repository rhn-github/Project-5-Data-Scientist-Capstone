Final Project
A readme file contains relevant information about the files in a project's directory. A readme should provide just enough context to get other users up and running with your code. Keep in mind, we are writing README for other users.

Start with a title and a description: be sure to capture the spirit of your project clearly and concisely. This will help frame the reader's experience when going through your documentation.
Next, include any information that is absolutely necessary for understanding your code. This may be dependencies on other software or libraries, installation instructions, common usage, or known bugs.
You can also add other information, such as about the author and software license
